2024-06-09: Version 2.00
            [New Features]
            - Added a return value to 'add' method from Kelp::Routes,
              * it can be used to call add again, adding a child and making the parent a bridge
            - Added before_dispatch hook in Kelp
            - Added Kelp::Util, which contains some general utilities (previously as private code in Kelp::Routes)
            - Added has_name and dest methods to Kelp::Routes::Pattern
            - Kelp::Generator has a new filename shortcut: DOT (dotfiles support)

            [Changes]
            - Kelp::Routes module overhaul
              * Handles reblessing the app into a controller class by itself, with rebless => 1
              * Kelp::Routes::Controller is no longer required, but will be kept for backward compatibility
              * Resolves all of its checks at application build time (not during the request dispatching)
              * Does stricter validation of routing configuration
              * Route building errors can now be turned into exceptions (rather than just being skipped), with fatal => 1
              * Easier to subclass due to new overridable methods: format_to and load_destination
              * More performant at runtime, especially for deeply nested trees with many bridges
            - Removed safe_param configuration field, since param method is now safe by default
            - Improved the quality of configuration generated by the 'kelp' template

            [Backward-Incompatible Changes]
            - Disable unsafe param calls (cgi_param may be used instead if necessary)
            - Routes with invalid destinations will no longer be added and yield HTTP status 404 instead of 500
            - Some specific extensions of Kelp::Routes may no longer work correctly due to stricter build-time route checks

            [Bug fixes]
            - Instances created with new_anon now have correct default 'base' for routes
            - Fixed bridge behavior in some cases by removing duplicated slashes from non-regex pattern
            - Kelp::Generator now ignores empty lines in index files

            [Examples]
            - Added an example script for benchmarking router matching and dispatching speeds in ex/router_bench.pl

            - Added safe_param configuration - see Kelp::Request::param
            - Added Kelp::Generator, allowing for pluggable generation templates and custom generation scripts
            - Rewrote the CLI script using Kelp::Generator

            - Kelp::Module::JSON will now prefer Cpanel::JSON::XS before other options
            - Kelp script now requires --type=less for a Kelp::Less app, instead of --less
            - All of Kelp file slurping is now done using Path::Tiny
            - POD fixes and improvements

            [Bug fixes]

2014-12-14: Version 0.9021

            [Bug Fixes]

            - POD fixes

            [New features]

            - Session now accepts hashref, which also allows for the destruction
              of the enitire session.
            - Add "include" function to config files, making it possible to include
              other file into the configuration.

2014-08-08: Version 0.9015

            [Bug Fixes]

            - Fix a typo causing a fatal error in Routes::Controller
            - Fix debug and error keywords in Kelp::Less
            - Remove an explicit return undef, per Perl::Critic

            [New Features and Improvements]

            - Allow for route methods outside of base class
              It is now possible to add a route that lives outside of the base class
              by prefixing it with '+'. This works for both Perl and camelized
              strings.

            - Add config keyword to Kelp::Less

            - Virtualize the logger instantiation
              Add a _logger function in Module::Logger, which creates the logger
              instance, making it easier to subclass the Logger module.
              Add a Logger::Simple module, which dumps everything to STDERR
              This module is convenient to use during development with Kelp::Less.

            - Update bin/Kelp
              * bin/Kelp --less <name> will now create a psgi file with the specified name
                (previously it would always create app.psgi).
              * Existing files will not be overwritten, unless --force specified.

            - Simplify Less application boilerplate
              Add a Config subclass with simplified configuration that will be used by
              default by any Kelp::Less application. This configuration will not load
              any modules or middleware, leaving it up to the user to manually load
              any modules needed.
              Additionally, bin/Kelp --less <name> will now only generate the psgi
              application, and not any other folders, views, templates etc.

            - Downgrade confess to croak and croak to die
              Kelp::Response used confess and croak excessively. Both changed to die,
              so that the user can control how much stack trace they want via the
              'long_error' attribute or the KELP_LONG_ERROR env variable.


2014-07-12: Version 0.9012

            [New features]
            - Add access to the application instance from the config files
            - Kelp.pm methods 'requiest' and 'response' renamed to 'build_request' and 'build_response', in order
              to minimize cofusion. NOTE: If your application is overriding any of those, make sure to rename them too.
            - Replace explicit UTF-8 encoding with $app->charset
            - Rename pattern attribute 'via' to 'method'. 'via' will still work as a shortcut to 'method', so
              this will not break backwards compatibility.

            [Fixes]
            - POD fixes

            [Other]
            - Using Pod::Markdown::Github to generate README.md from Kelp.pm

            - Config module optionally registers _cfg method, to help manipulate the configuration.
            - Add a cookie jar to Kelp::Test

2013-06-13: Version 0.3101
