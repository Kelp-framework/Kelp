=head1 NAME

Kelp::Manual::Controllers - Making your app use controllers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the technical aspect of implementing controllers in
your app. By default, Kelp application has no controllers - it resolves all
your routes in the context of the main app. In other words, all routes take a
instance of the web application as a first parameter - even if those routes
live in another class.

Controllers lets you separate some of the route handling logic to other classes
and have your subs take the object of the correct class as the first argument.

=head2 PSA: Modern controllers

New Kelp versions are very flexible when it comes to tweaking the call process
of a route. However, the core of the framework uses legacy "reblessing" system
of controllers for backward-compatibility reasons.

For all new projects which need controllers, you should configure your app to
use L<KelpX::Controller>. This extension implements a separate controller class
hierarchy, much more fitting for a modern web development. It is an official
extension supported by Kelp developers.

Refer to L<KelpX::Controller> documentation for details on setting that up. The
rest of this document contains only details about the legacy system, so it can
be safely ignored if you choose to use that extension.

=head2 Legacy controller details

Core Kelp uses reblessing as a method of implementing controllers. There is no
special base class for controllers - all controllers must be subclasses of
L<Kelp>.

Reblessing will happen after request is matched to a route. Route handler has
to be specified as class and method string, and class must be a subclass of class
configured for L<Kelp::Routes/base>. L<Kelp::Routes/rebless> must also be
enabled for that to occur.

The default value of C<base> field is the application class, so your
application class is by default your main controller class. All other
controllers must (directly or indirectly) inherit from your application class.

These methods will be automatically run on your controller object for each request:

=over

=item * route handler method

=item * hooks (if available)

=back

No other methods will be called from your controller unless you call them
explicitly yourself. Application will be reblessed into a given controller only
once per request. If a bridge route exists which uses the same controller as
the regular route, the regular route will reuse the controller reblessed for
the bridge. After the request ends, the reblessed controllers will be cleared.

=head2 Configuring controllers

=head3 Step 1: Configure the controller

It is a good practice to set up a different C<base>, so that you separate general
app code from request-handling code.

    # config.pl
    {
        modules_init => {
            Routes => {
                rebless => 1, # the app instance will be reblessed
                base => 'MyApp::Controller',
            }
        }
    }

=head3 Step 2: Create a main controller class

This step is only required if you've changed the C<base>.

    # lib/MyApp/Controller.pm
    package MyApp::Controller;
    use Kelp::Base 'MyApp';

    # Now $self is an instance of 'MyApp::Controller';
    sub service_method {
        my $self = shift;
        ...;
    }

    1;

=head3 Step 3: Create any number of controller classes

They all must inherit from your main controller class.

    # lib/MyApp/Controller/Users.pm
    package MyApp::Controller::Users;
    use Kelp::Base 'MyApp::Controller';

    # Now $self is an instance of 'MyApp::Controller::Users'
    sub authenticate {
        my $self = shift;
        ...;
    }

    1;

=head3 Step 4: Add routes with shorter class names

You no longer have to prefix destinations with the base controller class name.

    # lib/MyApp.pm

    ...

    sub build {
        my $self = shift;

        # if 'base' was not changed, this would have to be written as:
        # => 'Controller::Users::authenticate'
        $self->add_route('/login' => 'Users::authenticate');

    }

=head1 CAVEATS

There are some controller gotchas which come from a fact that they are not by
default constructed like a regular object:

=head2 Main application object is shallow-cloned before rebless

By default, controllers are only temporary. Setting top-level attributes in a
controller, for example L<Kelp/charset>, will work until the request is fully
handled. After that, the controller copy will be destroyed and the changes will
not propagate back to main application. Moreover, any extra fields you set in
the controller will be lost when the request handling is over.

If your main app has no changing state, a special configuration field
C<persistent_controllers> can be added to combat this. If it is set to a true
value, the app will be reblessed just once per controller. This means no
changes to the main app attributes will be visible in controllers, but the
controller will be free to set and use all of its attributes at will. This way
your controllers will be reused indefinetly and no changes in app's state will
propagade to controllers.

Note that by default, Kelp main class has no top-level state which may change
between requests so it should be pretty safe to enable this configuration as
long as you don't instantiate your controllers before app building is finished.

=head2 Getting a controller copy in C<build>

Controllers are never actually constructed, but instead the main app object is
cloned and reblessed into the correct class. Don't expect your override of
C<new> or C<build> to ever be called. No automatic controller initialization
happens in Kelp.

If you'd like to access a controller in other context than route handling - for
example in C<build> method, allowing you to move route definitions to the
controller - you may use C<context> tracking object:

    # in MyApp.pm
    sub build {
        my $self = shift;

        # get a temporary rebless of the app and call its bulid method
        # will return MyApp::Controller::Special, if route base is MyApp::Controller
        my $controller_special = $self->context->controller('Special');
        $controller_special->build;

        # will return the main controller (MyApp::Controller)
        my $controller = $self->context->controller;
        $controller->build;
    }

Note that you will still have to use the controller name in routes even though
they live in the same class:

    # in MyApp/Controller/Special.pm
    sub build {
        my $self = shift;

        # need to add special, even though this is controller special
        $self->add_route('/my_route' => 'special#handler');
    }

    sub handler { ... }

NOTE: Take extra care not to call C<build> again if it wasn't overridden in a
controller, as the controller will try to re-initialize the app, which will
surely B<result in a loop>! In addition, B<make sure to never call> C<<
$self->SUPER::build >> in a controller.

A little trick to make sure your build don't get called more than once is to
start it with a guard:

    sub build {
        my $self = shift;
        return unless ref $self eq __PACKAGE__;
    }

This way you don't have to worry about possibility of duplicated build calls
as a result of inheritance.

=head2 Getting a main application object in a controller

This may be done by similarly using C<context>:

    sub handler {
        my $controller = shift;

        # this will always be the main app object
        my $app = $controller->context->app;
    }
